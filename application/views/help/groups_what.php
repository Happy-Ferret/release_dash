            Fundamental building blocks of the RRDashboard. Each group contains a set of one or more queries, and represents a unique metric that is being monitored. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A group may be visualized in 2 different ways: a plot or a number. Plots provide the user with information on historical trends of the specified queries and bug counts. On the other hand, a "number" displays only the last known value for the query and is used when a view of historical trends is unneccessary. Note that choices in visualization methods <em>do not affect</em> the loading performance from Elastic Search.
