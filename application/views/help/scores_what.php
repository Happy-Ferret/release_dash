            Each version is linked to a release readiness score. The score is recorded and displayed in the form of a color being either green, orange or red. Intuitively, green indicates that the particular version is on track to becoming ready before the next scheduled release date. Orange indicates that the version is unhealthy with regards to the next release date and red simply means a coming disaster.
