            RRDashboard, also known as the Release Readiness Dashboard. The purpose of this tool is to automate the work revolving around watching bugs reported on <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>. Using a pre-specified set of metrics, the RRDashboard provides better visibility on the "release readiness" of important Mozilla products. The dashboard pulls data from an Elastic Search cluster, which mirrors the actual <a href="https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/">Bugzilla</a> database with a slight lag of about 15 minutes.
