            Default groups appear in <strong>all</strong> versions of a product. To create a custom group, click on the <i class="fa fa-plus"></i> button as seen in the image. A modal similar to that used in creating custom groups will appear. Note that only white-listed administrators are able to create default groups.

        <strong>Differences from custom groups</strong>
        <p>
            Because a single default group applies to many different versions, context must be adapted accordingly for the displayed group to provide relevant content. For this purpose, <a href="#groups_tags">soft tags</a> must be used in the entries when creating default groups. Reference lines as described for <a href="#groups_custom">custom groups</a> are also currently unavailable for default groups.
